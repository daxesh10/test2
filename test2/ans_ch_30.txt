the completeness of a reverse engineering process refers to the level of detail providied in the project or 
in other words the details of abstraction provided in abstartion level.as the completeness decrease as the 
abstraction level increase and vice versa as abstraction level increase completeness decreases
for exapmle a project in company they already have the source code so it is easy to develope a complete design
representaion and Architecture of the desing representaion can also be achived and derived
but it is difficult to make make all the UML models ie. data ï¬‚ow diagrams or entity-relationship models
for the same.

for achiving completeness not only abstraction plays important role but moreover the 
interactivty is also esential,as interaactivity is nothing but degree to which humans 
are interacting to system using automated tools to create effective reverse engineering 
process.if interactivty is not achived and abstarction level increases then completeness will suffer

# forward eng:
it is the set of activites that consume the products and atrifacts(ie. code) 
from a derived or exsisting software in order to match the new requirements for new system

forward engineering is also called renovation it basically renovation of the design inforamtion
from exsisting software and uses this inforamtion to alter the exsisting software in an effort to 
improve the quality. it not only adds the new functionality or improves the functionality 
but its boundaries encompasses  dealing with desing or architechure of the system.



# restructurin :

it is the process of transforming the system from one representation from to another at the same abstarction level
but it preserves the functionality of the system it basically leaves the system at same abstarction level 
genrally codeing level and instead arrages the code (ie . object orienting the code or structureness of code) in order to fit the paradigm

it deals with modification of source code or data it dosent tend to cahnge the program architechure.
it focuses on design details and local data structure that is defined in the module.

if the restructuring effort extends beyond module boundries and changes the software architecture 
it becomes forward engineering.
